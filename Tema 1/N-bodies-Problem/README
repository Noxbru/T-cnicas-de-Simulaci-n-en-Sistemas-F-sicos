This is similar code as in the repository
of the N-Bodies Problem:
https://github.com/Noxbru/N-bodies-Problem
but here, there isn't the RK algorithm

This is an iterative method to calculate
the evolution of a N-bodies system which
interact with gravitatory force.

You have to edit the 'program.c' code
to add new bodies, but I am thinking in
a way to add them via other methods, such
as keyboard or a file.

To change/add new bodies, you have to change
the variable Earth_Moon.n to the number of
bodies. Then, the bodies are writen following
this pattern: {Mass, {Position vector},
{Velocity vector}, {dv vector}, {dr vector},
Whether is fixed or not}

Maybe, to get the results you need, you will
have to make more steps changing the upper
limit for 'time'. Or make the steps a
different size in 'sistem.h'
