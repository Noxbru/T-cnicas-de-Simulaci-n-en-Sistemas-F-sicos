These are the Exercises and the problems of Lesson 1:

Exercise 1: Harmonic oscilator in 1 dimension using
Euler and Verlet algorithms.

Exercise 2: N-Particles with gravitatory interaction
using Euler and Verlet algorithms.

Problem 1: Plot some variables in function of the
time of the simulation. Compare with the analitic
solution. [Exercise 1]

Problem 2 (ampliation): After N steps, reverse time
and see what happen. [Exercise 1]

Problem 3 (ampliation): Simulate the Earth-Moon
system.
